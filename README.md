## How it works

TruthFeed gives users the opportunity to review the validity of news articles posted by other TruthFeed users. When submitting new articles, users include information about the title, author(s), and source of the piece as well as a hyperlink to the article. Once the article is submitted, it will appear on TruthFeed and can then be validated! Users can rate the validity of the author, source, and content of the article. The scores from the individual review are then used along with the other reviews on the same article to calculate the overal validity rating for that article. When leaving reviews, users are also encouraged to explain their reasoning via a comment box.
